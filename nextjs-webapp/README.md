# Next JS App

Nextjs is choosen for the frontend developemt.

I have used Zustand state management. i kept frontend arch as lean as possible. All the UI code is in the homepage.
and everything is divided into components and placed in (components) folder. Created Server Actions to fetch data from the backend. I have added basic translate and scale animations using framer motion.

The UI is self explaintory and easy to use requires.

I apologize, if you are not pleased with the UI design.
